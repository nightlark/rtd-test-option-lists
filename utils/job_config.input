For app dims, choose any 3 grid suitable for the application. If the dimensions
do not matter, simply use "#ranks 1 1".

For node dim, choose how you would like to arrange ranks with a node. If the
dimensions do not matter, simply use "#ranks_per_node 1 1".

For router shape, choose how you would like to arrange nodes with a router. If
it does not matter, simply use "#nodes_per_router 1 1".
